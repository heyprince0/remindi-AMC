## What It Does

Managing AMCs manually is painful — scattered Excel sheets, handwritten quotations, missed renewal dates, and clients who never received a proper invoice. Remindi fixes that.

- **Quotation Generation** — Create professional PDF quotations with your company branding, GSTIN/PAN details, itemized line items, and GST breakdowns
- **Invoice Generation** — Convert quotations to invoices in one click; includes payment details (bank transfer + UPI), amount in words, and optional order numbers
- **Client Management** — Maintain a clean database of your AMC clients with contract details
- **Company Profile** — Set up your business once (name, address, GSTIN, PAN, logo) and it auto-populates all your documents
- **PDF Thumbnails** — Optional branded header thumbnail on all PDF exports
- **GST-Compliant Documents** — CGST/SGST/IGST breakdown, tax totals, and compliant invoice formatting out of the box
